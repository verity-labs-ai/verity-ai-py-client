The  Company  generally  does  not  require  collateral  from  its  customers;  however,  the\\nCompany will require collateral or third-party credit support in certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible, the Company attempts to limit credit\\nrisk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers or by requiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. These credit-\\nfinancing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume any\\nrecourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements.\\n\\nAs of both April 1, 2023 and September 24, 2022, the Company had one customer that represented 10% or more of total trade receivables, which accounted for\\n10%. The Company‚Äôs cellular network carriers accounted for 32% and 44% of total trade receivables as of April 1, 2023 and September 24, 2022, respectively.\\n\\nVendor Non-Trade Receivables\\n\\nThe Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components to these vendors who manufacture\\nsubassemblies  or  assemble  final  products  for  the  Company.
